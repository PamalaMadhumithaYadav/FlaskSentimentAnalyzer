# FlaskSentimentAnalyzer
This project implements a web-based sentiment analyzer for restaurant reviews using a Flask backend and a scikit-learn machine learning model. Users can enter a restaurant review into a text area, and the application will predict whether the sentiment of the review is "Positive" or "Negative". It also displays a confidence score for the prediction.
